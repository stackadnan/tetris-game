# Valence Message System - Testing Guide

## System Overview
The dynamic sequencing system now passes fixed valence messages based on sequence position (not file round) to ensure consistent emotional progression regardless of randomization order.

## Testing URLs
Use these URLs to test each sequence round directly:

### Sequence Round 1 (Positive Valence)
```
https://stackadnan.github.io/tetris-game/?competition=high&mode=vs&round=1&winMsg=Boom!%20You're%20on%20fire%20ðŸ”¥&lossMsg=Hey,%20not%20bad.%20You'll%20bounce%20back!&tieMsg=Nice%20clash!%20This%20is%20gonna%20be%20fun.
```

### Sequence Round 2 (Negative Valence)
```
https://stackadnan.github.io/tetris-game/?competition=high&mode=vs&round=2&winMsg=You%20wonâ€¦%20barely.%20Don't%20get%20cocky.&lossMsg=Yikes.%20That%20one%20hurt,%20huh?&tieMsg=Still%20stuck?%20Maybe%20you're%20slipping...
```

### Sequence Round 3 (Neutral Valence)
```
https://stackadnan.github.io/tetris-game/?competition=high&mode=vs&round=3&winMsg=That's%20done.%20Let's%20tally%20things%20up.&lossMsg=Well...%20that's%20over.&tieMsg=Okay.%20That%20happened.
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Console Verification
Open browser Developer Tools (F12) â†’ Console tab and verify:

**URL Parameter Extraction:**
```
Game initialized: Competition=high, Round=1, Mode=vs
Valence Messages - Win: "Boom! You're on fire ðŸ”¥", Loss: "Hey, not bad. You'll bounce back!", Tie: "Nice clash! This is gonna be fun."
```

**Message Selection Logic:**
```
=== CHAT DEBUGGING ===
Game winner determined as: player
Available valence messages - Win: Boom! You're on fire ðŸ”¥, Loss: Hey, not bad. You'll bounce back!, Tie: Nice clash! This is gonna be fun.
====================
```

### 2. Game Outcome Testing
For each sequence round URL:

1. **Test Player Victory** - Let player win the match
   - Should display `winMsg` (CPU acknowledges player's victory)
   - Round 1: "Boom! You're on fire ðŸ”¥"
   - Round 2: "You wonâ€¦ barely. Don't get cocky."
   - Round 3: "That's done. Let's tally things up."

2. **Test Player Defeat** - Let CPU win the match  
   - Should display `lossMsg` (CPU comments on player's defeat)
   - Round 1: "Hey, not bad. You'll bounce back!"
   - Round 2: "Yikes. That one hurt, huh?"
   - Round 3: "Well... that's over."

3. **Test Tie Game** - End with same scores
   - Should display `tieMsg`
   - Round 1: "Nice clash! This is gonna be fun."
   - Round 2: "Still stuck? Maybe you're slipping..."
   - Round 3: "Okay. That happened."

### 3. Qualtrics Integration Testing
Test the complete workflow through Qualtrics round files:

1. Load round files in any order (randomization)
2. Verify sequence tracking in embedded data: `CurrentSequence`
3. Check that messages match sequence position (not file position)
4. Confirm data collection includes correct messages

## Expected Results

### Message Perspective
- **Player Wins**: CPU acknowledges player's victory with `winMsg`
- **Player Loses**: CPU comments on player's defeat with `lossMsg` 
- **Tie**: CPU gives neutral response with `tieMsg`

### Emotional Progression
Regardless of file execution order:
1. **First game played**: Always positive/encouraging
2. **Second game played**: Always negative/tense
3. **Third game played**: Always neutral/flat

### Data Collection
Messages should be stored in Qualtrics embedded data:
- `OpponentChat1`, `OpponentChat2`, `OpponentChat3`
- Content should reflect sequence position, not file round

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Wrong messages displayed**: Check URL encoding of parameters
2. **Fallback messages used**: Verify parameters are being passed correctly
3. **Sequence tracking broken**: Check `CurrentSequence` embedded data field

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Check URL parameters
console.log(new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('winMsg'));

// Check winner determination
console.log('Game winner:', window.gameWinner);

// Check message selection
console.log('Selected message:', text);
```

## Success Criteria
âœ… URL parameters extracted correctly  
âœ… Messages match sequence position (not file)  
âœ… Winner determination works for all outcomes  
âœ… Messages display in chat interface  
âœ… Data collection includes sequence-based messages  
âœ… Emotional progression maintained across randomization
